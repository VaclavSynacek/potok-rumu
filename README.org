# Potok rumu

*means stream of rum in czech*

Small [Tenzing][tenzing] generated ClojureScript React SPA (courtesy of
[Rum][rum]), for my experiments with Reactive streams (courtesy of
[Potok][potok]).

## Development

You need [Boot][boot] installed.

Then you are just one `boot dev` away from running app on `localhost:3000`.
